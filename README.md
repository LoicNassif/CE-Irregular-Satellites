# Direct Imaging of Irregular Satellite Disks in Scattered Light

Source code from Nassif and Tamayo (2019): https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09377. Computes irregular satellite collisional evolution following models from Kennedy and Wyatt (2011). The jupyter\_examples folder provides the notebooks used to generate each of the figures in Nassif and Tamayo (2019), and  demonstrate how to use the API in swarms.py.
